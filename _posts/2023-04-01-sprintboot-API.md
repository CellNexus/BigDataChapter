To develop and deploy a REST API using these technologies, you would typically follow these steps:
<br>
Set up your development environment: You'll need to install Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Docker on your machine.
<br>
Design your API: You'll need to determine the resources that your API will expose and the endpoints that clients will use to interact with those resources.
<br>
Build your API: You'll use Spring Boot to build your API, using the Spring MVC framework to handle incoming requests and provide responses. You'll also use MySQL to store data for your API.
<br>
Test your API: You'll need to test your API to ensure that it works as expected. You can use tools like Postman to send requests to your API and verify the responses.
<br>
Package your API using Docker: You'll use Docker to package your API and all its dependencies into a container. This container can then be deployed to any environment that supports Docker.
<br>
Deploy your API: You'll deploy your containerized API to a server or cloud provider. You can use tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage and scale your containers.

<br>
Eclipse: Eclipse is a free, open-source IDE that is widely used by Java developers. It provides a rich set of features, including code completion, debugging, and testing tools.
<br>

IntelliJ IDEA: IntelliJ IDEA is a commercial IDE that is also widely used by Java developers. It provides advanced features such as refactoring, code analysis, and intelligent code completion.
<br>

NetBeans: NetBeans is a free and open-source IDE that provides a complete development environment for Java developers. It has a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of plugins for additional functionality.
<br>

Here we use [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) in this demo.
