Github Actions now has support for CI/CD. What this means is that developers can now start using GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline. In this tutorial, we are going to build a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions and call Python funcion, the pipeline will test hyperlinks about open-source health websites or libs.

 <strong>Continuous integration (CI)</strong> is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. CI using GitHub Actions offers workflows that can build the code in your repository and run your tests.

Kakoni, I, with another contributors, create and maintenance <a href="https://github.com/SherylGit/awesome-healthcare">awesome-healthcare</a>. (fork from Kakoni's original repository, CI code is under review and pull requst)

Curated list of awesome open source healthcare software, libraries, tools and resources. Each link has been vetted to ensure the project is active and provides value to healthcare facilities, providers, developers, policy experts, and/or research scientists.

There are links, urls which navigate users to find corresponding source. But one issue is identified that one link may be changed or trigger connection error. So it has a request to validate these links.

Here, I proposed one solution by using GitHub CI and one Python file to check these links one by one, and show our developers or data analyst to clear know which one needs updates. 

Aim: automatically do links validation, and notice developers or data anlyst, but avoid to send annoy action error notification email to everyone.

Design: GitHub CI automatically run testing, and shows results when one push event happens.

<h4 class="header" id="quantization">Step 2: GitHub Action</h4>

If Actions has been activated on your account you will see the actions tab appear on your repo.

Here, we know workflow, so here click: set up a workflow yourself

<em class="figure">Fig 5. GitHub Action: set up a workflow yourself.</em>
<br>


 we change workflow file as python.yml

<br>

<strong>name: CI</strong>

This is just specifying a name for the workflow.

<strong>on: [push]</strong>

The on command is used to specify an event that will trigger the workflow, this event can be push, pull_request, etc. It can also be an array of events like this.

In our case, we are simply saying trigger this workflow on every push

<strong>jobs:</strong>

Here we are specifying the job we want to run, in this case, we are setting up a build job.

<strong>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</strong>

The runs-on is specifying the OS you want your workflow to run on and we are using the latest version of ubuntu

<strong>Steps:</strong>

Steps just indicate the various steps you want to run on that job

<strong>uses: actions/checkout@v1</strong>

Github has some already define Actions, we are using version 1 of the checkout action this is responsible for cloning the repo and checking into our project directory.

<strong>actions/setup-python@v2</strong>

Set action ,and pyther verion, and architecture.

<strong>run: pip3 install requests</strong> is preparing requests lib for test_script.py

<strong>run: python test_script.py</strong> will link validation codes.

Other codes leave there as default, or you could set other steps or echo.

Click Start commit at right side, and Commit new file.


<hr class="with-margin">
<h4 class="header" id="quantization">Step 3: Run pipeline, workflow file</h4>
After commit the workfile or any to master branch, will trigger workflow file and run pipline.

Go to Action:
![gitaction6]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2020-09-14/githubci-action-6.png){: .small70-image}
<em class="figure">Fig 6. Find Action</em>
<br>


Click Create python.yaml:

<em class="figure">Fig 7a. Action interface</em>

<em class="figure">Fig 9a. view your pipeline detail, here is in processing</em>
<br>

Here pipelne is finshed, and there is no error. If there is any error, you will see error icon. 
Because here, we does not throgh exception, so even this is non-exist link, there is no error, 
unless your codes has some issues.

<em class="figure">Fig 9b. view your pipeline detail, finished, and no error happens</em>
<br>

Click Run python test_script_py to check results.

<em class="figure">Fig 10. Check result.</em>

<hr class="with-margin">
<h4 class="header" id="quantization">Step 4: Run pipeline, workflow file if there is error or excetion</h4>

Please try this part yourself. You and any this Repo contributor will get pipeline fail email. 

Here just show one result:
