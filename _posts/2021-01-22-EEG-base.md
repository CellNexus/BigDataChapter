 The EEG is an electrophysiological technique for the recording of electrical activity arising from the human brain. Given its exquisite temporal sensitivity, the main utility of EEG is in the evaluation of dynamic cerebral functioning.

<blockquote class="tip">
  An <strong>electroencephalogram (EEG)</strong> is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp. Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep.

  An EEG is one of the main diagnostic tests for epilepsy. An EEG can also play a role in diagnosing other brain disorders. For example, EEG may be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during surgical procedures; given its great sensitivity in showing sudden changes in neural functioning even as they first occur, it has proven quite helpful in this setting in monitoring for potential complications such as ischemia or infarction. EEG waveforms may also be averaged, giving rise to evoked potentials (EPs) and event-related potentials (ERPs), potentials that represent neural activity of interest that is temporally related to a specific stimulus. EPs and ERPs are used in clinical practice and research for analysis of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and higher cognitive functioning.

<h4 class="header" id="quantization">Brain electrical activity</h4>

The brain consists of billions of cells, half of which are neurons, half of which help and facilitate the activity of neurons. These neurons are densely interconnected via synapses, which act as gateways of inhibitory or excitatory activity.
<br>
Any synaptic activity generates a subtle electrical impulse referred to as a postsynaptic potential. Of course, the burst of a single neuron is difficult to reliably detect without direct contact with it. However, whenever thousands of neurons fire in sync, they generate an electrical field which is strong enough to spread through tissue, bone, and skull. Eventually, it can be measured on the head surface. <br>

<h4 class="header" id="quantization">EEG Definition</h4>

<br>
EEG measures electrical activity generated by the synchronized activity of thousands of neurons (in volts). <br>
EEG provides excellent time resolution, allowing you to detect activity within cortical areas -even at sub-second timescales. <br>
As the voltage fluctuations measured at the electrodes are very small, the recorded data is digitized and sent to an amplifier. The amplified data can then be displayed as a sequence of voltage values.

<h4 class="header" id="quantization">Why it's done </h4>

An EEG can determine changes in brain activity that might be useful in diagnosing brain disorders, especially epilepsy or another seizure disorder. An EEG might also be helpful for diagnosing or treating the following disorders:Brain damage from head injury,Stroke, Sleep disorders, seizure ..... .

The names of the electrode sites use alphabetical abbreviations that identify the lobe or area of the brain which each electrode records from:<br>

F = frontal
<br>
Fp = frontopolar<br>
T = temporal<br>
C = central<br>
P = parietal<br>
O = occipital<br>
A = auricular (ear electrode)<br><br>
The localization of the brain waves within the brain regions or lobes is further narrowed by adding electrodes, which are given numbers such as T3, T4, P3, P4. Even numbers identify electrode positions on the right side of the head, and odd numbers refer to the left side. The label "z" points to electrode sites in the midline of the head. For example, Cz refers to the midline central region of the head.<br>

As EEG monitors the time course of electrical activity generated by the brain, you can interpret which areas of the cortex are responsible for processing information at a given time:<br>

<strong>Occipital cortex:</strong> The occipital cortex is the visual processing center of our brain, located in the rearmost portion of the skull. All the things that we see are processed here (although some processing does also occur before and after the signal arrives). EEG experiments with visual stimuli (videos, images) often focus on effects in occipital regions.<br>

<strong>Parietal cortex:</strong> The parietal cortex is all about integrating information stemming from external sources and internal sensory feedback from our body. The parietal cortex is responsible for merging all of these information sources into a coherent representation of how our body relates to the environment, and how all things (objects, people) in the environment spatially relate to us. Tasks requiring eye or hand movements as well as eye-hand coordination would be impossible without parietal cortex, which also processes, stores and retrieves the shape, size and orientation of objects to be grasped.<br>

<strong>Temporal cortex:</strong> The temporal cortex is associated with processing sensory input to derived, or higher, meanings using visual memories, language and emotional associations. The left temporal cortex is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language. Medial (inner) regions are more active during spatial navigation.<br>

<strong>Frontal cortex:</strong> The frontal part of the human brain is enlarged compared to most other mammals. Basically, the frontal cortex is all about executive function: it helps us maintain control, plan for the future, and monitor our behavior. Apart from the regional characteristics of where certain electrical activity originates, you can also analyze which frequencies primarily drive the ongoing activity.<br>

<h4 class="header" id="quantization">EEG Signal Features Extraction</h4>

There are many methods developed for signal features extraction. Technically, a feature represents a distinguishing property, a recognizable measurement, and a functional component obtained from a section of a pattern. Extracted features are meant to minimize the loss of important information embedded in the signal. In addition, they also simplify the amount of resources needed to describe a huge set of data accurately. This is necessary to minimize the complexity of implementation, to reduce the cost of information processing, and to cancel the potential need to compress the information. 
<br>
Various regions of the brain do not emit the same brain wave frequency simultaneously. An EEG signal between electrodes placed on the scalp consists of many waves with different characteristics. The large amount of data received from even one single EEG recording makes interpretation difficult. The brain wave patterns are unique for every individual.

<br>
<strong>Brain wave samples for different waveforms:</strong>
Brain waves are oscillating electrical voltages in the brain measuring just a few millionths of a volt. There are five widely recognized brain waves, and the main frequencies of human EEG waves are listed in Table 2.1 along with their characteristics.
<br>

<em class="figure">Fig 6. Characteristics of the Five Basic Brain Waves.</em>
<br>

<strong>Delta (1 – 4 Hz) :</strong>
Delta in sleep labs, delta waves are examined to assess the depth of sleep. The stronger the delta rhythm, the deeper the sleep. Increased delta power (an increased quantity of delta wave recordings) has also been found to be associated with increased concentration on internal working memory task.
<br>

<strong>Theta (4 – 7 Hz)  :</strong>
Theta is associated with a wide range of cognitive processing such as memory encoding and retrieval as well as cognitive workload. Whenever we’re confronted with difficult tasks (counting backwards from 100 in steps of 7, or when recalling the way home from work, for example), theta waves become more prominent. Theta is also associated with increased fatigue levels.
<br>

<strong>Alpha (7 – 12 Hz) :</strong>
Alpha whenever we close our eyes and bring ourselves into a calm state, alpha waves take over. Alpha levels are increased when in a state of relaxed wakefulness. Biofeedback training often uses alpha waves to monitor relaxation. They are also linked to inhibition and attention.
<br>

<strong>Beta (12 – 30 Hz) :</strong>
Beta over motor regions, beta frequencies become stronger as we plan or execute movements of any body part. Interestingly, this increase in beta is also noticeable as we observe bodily movements of other people. Our brain seemingly mimics their limb movements, indicating that there is an intricate “mirror neuron system” in our brain which is potentially coordinated by beta frequencies.
<br>

<strong>Gamma (>30 Hz, typically 40 Hz):</strong>
Gamma-Some researchers argue that gamma reflects attentive focusing and serves as carrier frequency to facilitate data exchange between brain regions [7]. Others associate gamma with rapid eye movements, so-called micro-saccades, which are considered integral parts for sensory processing and information uptake.
