<strong>Oracle Cloud (OCI)</strong> is a cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers. The company allows these services to be provisioned on demand over the Internet. 

New Always Oracle Cloud Free services have been added, including Arm Ampere A1 Compute. For large-scale Arm development projects you can apply for OCI Arm Accelerator.

<strong>WordPress</strong> is a free and open-source content management system written in hypertext preprocessor language and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database with supported HTTPS. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as "Themes".

WordPress uses a database management system called <strong>MySQL</strong>, which is open source software. This means you'll sometimes hear your site's database referred to as a “MySQL database.” MySQL is what enables the database to store information and provide you with access to it.


<strong>Nginx</strong> is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license.


<strong>Docker</strong> is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

<strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> is a non-profit certificate authority run by Internet Security Research Group that provides X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security encryption at no charge.

By using Oracle Cloud always free tier, create one compute instance VM (Check prevous post for more details and steps).

After login VM, update system and reoot.

```
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
Reboot:

```
sudo reboot
```

Please note here is "Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu". Not Docker or Docker desktop
<br>


<br>
Install
<br>

```
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```
<br>

<em class="figure">Fig. install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS</em>
<br>


Add Docker’s official GPG key:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```


Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

If error happens, like 
```
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Package docker-ce is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'docker-ce' has no installation candidate
E: Unable to locate package docker-ce-cli
E: Unable to locate package containerd.io
E: Couldn't find any package by glob 'containerd.io'
E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'containerd.io'
E: Unable to locate package docker-compose-plugin
```

try this
```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` test"
sudo apt update
```

then install

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

install docker-compose
```
sudo apt  install docker-compose
```
