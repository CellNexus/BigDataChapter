Big Data techonlogy have the potential to automatically detect PD symptoms and inform clinicians about the progression of disease.
This chapter will introduce the knowledge about the big data in healthcare. There are some real-world data analysis by using machine 
learning, deep learning and stats for parkinson's disease or other disease.
Here, also provide a FHIR on Azure playground to learn FHIR, HL7 and EMR.

In addition, some big data analytics tools like Apache Hadoop and related database knowledge will be intrudced in some real cases.

<blockquote class="tip"><strong>Big Data, Big Dream </strong> Healthcare big data refers to collecting, analyzing and
 leveraging consumer, patient, physical, and clinical data that is too vast or complex
 to be understood by traditional means of data processing. 
 Instead, big data is often processed by machine learning algorithms and data scientists. 
 The rise of healthcare big data comes in response to the digitization of healthcare information 
 and the rise of value-based care, which has encouraged the industry to use data analytics to 
 make strategic business decisions. Faced with the challenges of healthcare data – such as volume, 
 velocity, variety, and veracity – health systems need to adopt technology capable of collecting, 
 storing, and analyzing this information to produce actionable insights.
